## Project Goals

- [ ] Move all code into the library; all functionality should be available seamlessly from the library's API
- [ ] Migrate to Python v3 syntax and leverage new language and standard library capabilities
- [ ] Docstrings and type-hints!
- [ ] Expose the *data* available within YANG modules and Git histories
- [ ] Sphinx docs
- [ ] Installable plugins

...yeah, these are probably lofty enough goals.  ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜¬
